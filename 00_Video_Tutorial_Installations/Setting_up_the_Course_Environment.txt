# Setting up the environment
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please first look at the video 'Conda_Environment_und_VSCode.mp4' in the folder '00_Video_Tutorial_Installation' (do not install any programs at this stage).

Note that (other than shown in the video) we will work with Python 3.11 in this course (so please do not install any other Python versions).

If you have watched the video, you can now follow the steps below:

1.) Install the latest Anaconda version
    Download-Link:  https://www.anaconda.com/download/success
    On Windows, make sure that Anaconda is specified in your path under user variables
    e.g.: C:\Users\your_username\AppData\Local\anaconda3\Scripts
    See also: https://youtu.be/z84UIZy_qgE
	
2.) Install the latest version of Visual Studio Code and look at the introductional Video-Tutorials
    Download-Link: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
    Video-Tutorials: Visual Studio Code -> Menu -> Help -> Video-Tutorials
    On Windows, make sure that Visual Studio Code is specified in your path under user variables
    e.g.: C:\Users\your_username\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\bin

3.) Install the following extensions in Visual Studio Code
    - Python
    - Jupyter
    - Docker
    - PDF Preview
    For details see the video 'Extensions' at:  https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos
    
4.) Create a new conda environment and install the required Python libraries
    In your Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or your Terminal (macOS), type the following:

    conda info --envs                        # command lists all available conda environments
    conda create -n daengenv python=3.11     # command creates a new conda environment named 'daengenv' with Python 3.11
    conda activate daengenv                  # command activates the new conda environment
    
    Use pip to install the required packages in your activated conda environment.
    For this, cd into the folder with the requirements.txt file.
    Make sure that the requirements.txt file is available in that folder.
    Make also sure that your conda environment 'daengenv' is activated.
    To install the required Python packages listed in 'requirements.txt', type:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

5.) Follow the video tutorial in the Kafka folder to set up the Kafka environment.
